                <h2> About </h2>
                <h3> I recently graduated as a Computer Science major from University of Washington with a Math minor. 
                    I specialize in conceptual thinking and designing iterative and recursive algorithms with decent knowledge in different
                    programming languages and frameworks. I have been accepted into the Master's program of UW and intend on getting my Master Degree.

                <h2> Purpose </h2>
                <h3> Initially, I struggled immensely with Computer Science and have questioned if this was what I wanted to pursue.
                    The critical thinking involved was difficult to grasp despite my expertise in Math. I want to share my experience and provide some insight on what skills are necessary
                    to develop. With this insight, I hope not only to encourage others, but also explain how I've grown as a programmer and why I am worthy to work for your company.</h3>

            <div class="Content">
                <h2> My experience at University of Washington Tacoma has helped me learn many skills as a programmer. However, in order to learn these skills
                    and be successful in my field required hours of hardwork, stress, and many intrusive feelings of self-doubt. My first programming class was an Introduction
                    to programming where we learned Python. I struggled immensely in that class and scored a 3.0 which was the lowest grade I've ever received in a class thus far.
                    None of what the teacher said made sense. Envisioning for loops was an immensely difficult task, I didn't even remotely understand how to parse through a file, and
                    even constructing my own functions seemed almost impossible. In all actuality, programming is similar to Math in the sense that you synthesize a problem and 
                    split it into multiple smaller pieces and interpret each piece in a way that is understandable to you (i.e with pseudocode typically) before
                    attempting to translate each step with code. I didn't understand this at the time and naturally, you may not either, but I found that attempting 
                    to program and continuously practicing difficult problems helped understand programming naturally so that even I managed to ace the final in the end 
                    despite never understanding his instructions.
                    <br> Initially, my grades in Computer Science were not A's like I had hoped, but after being accepted into the major,
                    I was able to grasp Computer Science a lot easier and for the most part, aced most of the classes that I had taken.
                    These are some strategies that were used to facilitate that. </br> </h2>

            <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"> Advice & Strategies</h3> 
            <div class="Tips">

                <div class="Tip1">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline"> Collaborate with others.</a> Forming tight-knit groups using various different channels such as Zoom and Discord
                    is an excellent way to gain additional support and learn from others. This varies across schools, but as long as the work
                    that is produced is your own, any collaborative work is welcome. Through my experience, I found that collaboration has had a 
                    profound impact on the work that I produced. </li> 
                </div>
                <div class="Tip2">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block;"> Don't take notes.</a> It's more important to pay attention to the concepts that are taught in class rather than mindlessly
                    writing everything down. Professors will typically record their lectures, so that crucial explanations can be revisited at your own leisure.
                    Paying attention to distinct words can help you uncover things that written notes couldn't. </li>

                <div class="Tip3">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline"> Break a problem into pieces.</a> Understand what is required for the problem and think about what classes, interfaces, and functions are needed to accomplish the task.
                    If you need a data structure to return the game state of a board, write a function for it. If you need to update the board, write a function for it.
                    This way, when you understand what needs to be done, you can simply call that function and focus your time on the next task. This also makes it easier
                    to focus and not be overwhelmed. </li> 
                </div>
                <div class="Tip4">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline"> Learn to be resourceful.</a> Collaboration is crucial, but one of the most important things I learned is that Google is your best friend.
                    In Computer Security, I was required to complete a variety of esoteric labs found on Seed Labs and the most important thing was not whether
                    or not I understood Cybersecurity. It's the fact that I was willing to learn and was willing to continue searching through the Web until I found
                    the information that I needed. This also enabled me to create a web page and connect it to an advanced relational database with the help of a partner
                    despite having no prior experience which is located on my <a href="https://github.com/nazimz99" style="text-decoration:none"> github. </a> </li>

                <div class="Tip5">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline"> Use visuals to help.</a> Creating visual diagrams is very useful for analyzing how a data structure works or discerning a pattern in an algorithm. </li>
                </div>
                <div class="Tip6">
                    <li> <a style="text-decoration: underline"> Use inductive reasoning.</a> Learning how to make generalizations by analyzing a sub-problem and applying it to the entire problem as a whole
                is very useful in simplifying and envisioning a problem. Don't focus on the entire problem, create a sub-problem that is manageable. </li>
